==ERGONODE RELEASE==

Ergonode is an Opensource PIM with sleek frontend UI
using Vue CLI + Nuxt, and backend APIs via Symfony.

The repository aims to provide easier deployment and
specific snapshots where we expect both frontend and 
backend Ergonode projects to work well.

As Ergonode evolves we hope to strenghthen the community
of contibutions that help make it an awesome product
in each release cycle.
